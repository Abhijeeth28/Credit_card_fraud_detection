# Credit_card_fraud_detection

In this project, I considered data from Kaggle for credit card fraud detection which has only 0.172% of fraud transactions of total transactions. 

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the data and built a logistic regression  model for binary classification.
